Collega, Trinity which was so dear to me, and which held
on iis foundation so many who had been kind to me both
when I wasa boy, and all through my Oxford life. Trinity

had never been unkind to me. There used to be much
snap-dragon growing on the walls opposite my freshman's
roomo there, and I had for years taken it as the emblem
of my own perpetual residenee even unto death in my
Univeraiiy. .-

On the morning oi the 23rd I left the Observaiory. Ι
have never seen Oxford since, exeepting iis spirea, as they
are seen from the railway.1

¹At length I revisited Oxford on Febmary aoth, 1878, after an absence
of just 32 years. Vide additional Note at the end of the volume.
