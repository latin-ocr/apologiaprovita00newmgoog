“Dublin, October 25, 1834.
“My dear Newman,

“A most ahoeking repert concoming you has reached me,
which indeed carries such an improbability en the iace ei it that you may
perhaps wonder at my giving it a thought ; and at first Ι did not, but finding
it repeated irem different quarters, it seems te me worth centradicting lor
the sake ei your character. Some Oxford undergraduates‚ Ι find, openly
report that when Ι was at Oriel last spring you absented yeurseli irem chapel
on purpose to avoid receiving the Communion along with me; and that yee
yourself declared this to be the case.

“I would not notice every idle rumour; but this has been so eonfidently
and so long asserted that it would be a satisfactien to me te be able te declare
its falsity as a fact, from your authority. Ι did indeed at once deelare my ’
utter unbelief 3 but then thiahas only the weight of my opinion; though an
opinion restiug Ι think on ne insufficient grounds. Ι did net profess te rest
my disbeliei on eur long, intimate, and confidential iriendship‚ which would
make it your right and your duty· if Ι did any thing te effend you er any
thing you might think materially wrong-te remonstrate with me 3—buten
your general character; which lwas persuaded would have made you inea·
pable‚ even had no such close connexion existed between us, ef conduct se
unehristian and inhuman. But, as Ι said, Ι should like ier yeur sake te br
able te contradict the report irem yeur own authority.

“ Ever yours very truly,
“R. WHATELYJ
