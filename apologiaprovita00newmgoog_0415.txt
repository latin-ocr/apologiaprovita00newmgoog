“ My Dear Dr. Newman,

“At the annual meeting ci the Glergy of the Diocese oi Hexham
and Newcastle, held a lew days ago at Newcastleuponl'yne, I was commis-
sioned by them to express to you their sincere sympathy, on account of the
slanderous accusatione, to which you have been so unjustly exposed. We
⁴ are iully aware that these foul calumnies were intended to injure the char-
acter oi the whole body oi the Catholic Glergy, and that your distinguished
name was singled out. in order that they might be more effectually propa-
gated. It is well that these poisoncus shafts were thus aimed, as no one
could more triumphantly repel them. The ‘Apologia pro Viti sut' will,
if possible, render still more illustrious the name oi its gifted author, and be
a lasting monument oi the victory oi truth, and the signal overthrow oi an
arrogant and reckless assailant.

‘¹ It may appear late ior us now to ask to join in your triumph, but as the
Annual Meeting oi the Northem Clergy does not take place till this time, it
is the first occasion offered us to present our united congratulations. and to
declare to you, that by none oi your brethren arc you more esteemed and
venerated, than by the Clergy oi the Diocese oi Hexham and Newcastle.

“ Wishing that Almighty (lod may prolong your lile many more years ior
the defence oi our holy religion and the honour oi your brethren,

“I am, dear Dr. Newmun,

“ Yours sincerely in Jesus Christ,
“RALPH PROVOST PLATT, V.G.

“ The Very Rev. J. H. Newman.”
