why do all others beside, above, beneath it, in aud 01101 the 1111110111.
though being 01 the same 111110, 1111111 perfeko dry? Why should it
sweat, the whole church being so dry that 1011 single humid spot 011

certain period. that is 11011 October la. the anniversary 01 depositing, to

‘⁸ Το this point Ι 111 two facts which may be proved beyond any doubt:
the one by unquestionable historioal 1100111, the other by still living eye
witnesses. WhenunderBishopFriedriohvon Parsbsrgtheinterdictwesin·

prolueely dropping with 011, that the golden 1111 fixed underneath was lull

Some weelrs later arrived the long·wished·ior royal decree which sanctioned

‘¹ Moreover, let one try to gether water which is dropping lrom sweating
stone, or glase, or metal, and let him see 11 11 will be pure and limpid, or
rather muddy, filthy‚ and cloudy. The 011 01 St. Walburga on the contrary,
