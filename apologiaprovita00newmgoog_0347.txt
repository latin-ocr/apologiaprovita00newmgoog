as ontheother3 andii' Gibbon inconsidered worthyof praise
lor his stubborn incredulity in receiving the evidence
for this miracle, I do not see why I am to be blamed, ill
wish to be quite sure ol the full appositeneaa oi the recent
evidence which is brought to its disadvantage. Quostions
ol' fact cannot be disproved by analogice or presumptions;
the inquiry must be made into the particular case in all
its parts, as it comes before ua. Meanwhile, I fully allow
that the points of evidence brought in disparagement of
the miracle are primda socia of such cogency, that, till they
are proved to be irrelevant, Catholica are prevented from
appealing to it for controversial purposea
