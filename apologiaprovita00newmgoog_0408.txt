liverad over to other hands, and the Fathera removed to the district of
Edgbaston‚ where up to that time nothing Gathoh'o had appeared. Then
arose under your direction the large convent of the Oratory‚ the ohurch
expanded hydegrees into its present oapaoiousness,anumer0us congregation
has gathered and grown in it ; poor schools and other picus institutione have
grown up in connexion with it, and, moreover‚ equally at your expense and
that of your brethren. and, asI have reason to know, at much inconveniente,
the Oratory has relieved the other olergy of Birmingham all this while by
constantly doing the duty in the poor-house and gaol of Birmingham.

“ More recently still, the mission and the poor school at Smethwiok owe
their existence to the Oratory. And all this while the founder and father of
these religious works has added to his other solicitudes the toil of frequent
preaohing of attendanoe in the confessional‚ and other parochial duties.

“I have read on this day of its publication the seventh part of the
Apologia, and the touohing allusion in it to the devotedness of the Catholio
clergy to the poor in seasons of'pestilence reminds me that when the cholera
raged so dreadfully at Bilston, and the two priests of the town were nolonger
equal to the number of cases to which they were hurried day and night. 1

refer to the school for the edueation of tha higher classes, which at the y

Surely after reading this hare enumeration of work done, no man will ἵ
venture to say that Dr. Newman is leading a comparatively inaotive life in ἶ
the service of the Church. .

“ To spere, my dear Dr. Newman, any further pressure on those feelings ’ἶ

with which l have already taken so large a liberty, Ι will only add one word ¹

more for my own satisfaction. During our long intercourse there is only
one subject on which, after the first experience, 1 have measured my words

with some eaution, and that has been where questions bearing on eccle· 3'

siastical duty have arisen. I found some little cantion necessary, because

you were always so prompt end ready to go even beyond the slightest -

intimation of my wish or desires.

“That God may bless you with health‚ life, and all the spiritual good
which you desire, you and your brethren of the Oratory, is the earnest
prayer now and often of,

“My dear Dr. Newman,
“Your affectionate friend and faithful servant
in Christ,
