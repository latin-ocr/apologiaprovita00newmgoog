for me to be egotistiea13 nor to be oritieized for being so.

It isnot pleasant to reveal to high and low, young and
old, what has gone on within me from my early years.
It is not pleasant to be giving to every shallow or flippant
disputant the advantage over me of knowing my most
private thoughts, Imight even say the intercourse between

myself and my Maker. ButI do not like to be ealled to

my face a liar and aknave3 nor should lIbe doing my
duty to my faith or to my name, if Iwere to suffer it I

know Ι have done nothing to deserve such an insult, and
if Ι prove this, as I hope to do, I must not aare for sueh
incidental annoyanees as are involved in the process.
